## Description
Attached you find a randomly sampled extract of some of our policies.
We want to be able to predict the "number_of_payment_faults" 
(this is the number of payment attempts which failed when we try to charge the money for the policy from the customer) in the future for each new policy.
There is a small legend in the document to describe some of the fields.
If there are open questions about the data you can't answer by yourself do not hesitate to approach us!
Feel free to use whatever tool or language you feel comfortable with to solve the task.

## Task
Create a statistical model to predict the "number_of_payment_faults" for a policy.
There is no fixed or expected outcome what we want to see from you. 
We prefer quality over speed. 
It does not only matter if your solution yields correct results, but also your overall project structure, tools used, etc.
